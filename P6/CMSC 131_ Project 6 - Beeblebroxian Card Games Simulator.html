Please note that there are two elements to this project; the deck of cards
and the evaluation of hands of cards.  They are related to each other in
theme and in terms of practice with data structures and with logic and would
both be needed to implement a full Beeblebroxian Card Games Simulator.
However, the two elements do not interact in the JUnit tests, so if you get
stuck on something in one element of the project, you can switch to working
on the other until you have a chance to come in to office hours.
<br><br>
There is a <b>Launcher.java</b> class that will bring up a visualization of the 
deck with which you can interact to visually test building the deck, as 
well as cutting the deck, dealing from the deck, and shuffling the deck.
The hand evaluators all need to be tested via JUnit tests for your own
testing and debugging needs.
<br><br>
Suggested target for (a) building the deck, being able to get cards from it, and
the number of cards, and (b) evaluating Beeblejack hands
is before end of office hours Friday, November 11th.
<br><br>
Suggested target for 
evaluting hasPair, hasThreeOfAKind, hasFourOfAKind, hasFiveOfAKind
is by end of Sunday, November 13th.
<br><br>
Suggested target for all non-challenge elements is before end of office hours 
Friday, November 17th.
<br><br>
Graded: assignment submission due on Submit Server before 8pm on Monday, November 21st.

<h2 align="left"><u>Overview</u></h2>
<p align="left">
In this project, you will utilize both 
Java's ArrayList<type> class
and
Java arrays.
The goal is to understand both and be able to consider the advantages
and disadvantages of each so that in future courses, you can make
educated decisions.  It is critical that you use the storage approach
we mandate in this project.  For example, if we tell you to use an
ArrayList for something (such as the Deck) and you use an array instead, 
all points associated with that will be deducted, even if it "passes" on the
submit server.
</type></p>
<p>
This project will have you designing and implementing several related
classes; a deck of cards and some game evaluation methods.
The deck and games bear some similarities to a standard deck of cards
and the games of Poker and Blackkjack but there are differences; these
are for the Beeblebroxian Casino, soon to open on Mars.
<b>You don't (and unless you hail from the vicinity of Betelgeuse, can't) 
have previous experience with this deck and these games.</b>
We'll explain everything!
As always, you will have starter files provide and this document will
specify the specifications for the methods.
There is a GUI provided to allow you to "see" the deck to provide some
help in debugging errors related to the deck, but JUnit testing will be 
your friend for much of this project!
</p>
<p>
You will design and implement one Java data structure class
(the <b>Deck</b> which represents a deck of cards) using an 
<b>ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;</b> to store and manipulate the contents of the deck
as well as 
<b>HandEvaluatorBBXP</b>, which contains several static methods that 
evaluate the contents of arrays of 5 cards to determine which 
"Beeblebroxian Poker" hand(s) are represented
and
<b>HandEvaluatorBeeblejack</b>, which contains two static methods 
that evaluate the contents of ArrayList objects
connected to the game of Beeblejack.
as well as a series of <b>JUnit tests</b> in another class.

<h2 align="left"><u>Cards</u></h2>
<p align="left">If you are not familiar with the Beeblebroxian deck of 45 playing 
cards (which you aren't) and the terminology that goes along with it 
("suit", "Ace", "clubs", etc.), then you'll need to 
take a look at the

<blockquote>
	<p align="left">
        The Deck class represents a deck of cards.&nbsp; It starts 
	off with 45 cards, but as cards are dealt from the deck, the number of cards 
	(and the ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; that holds them) becomes smaller. 
        </p>
	<p align="left">The class has one private instance variable that stores the 
	ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; of references to Cards that are currently in the Deck:
        You <b>must</b> use the ArrayList for this class.  You may <b>not</b> add 
        any arrays to this class except one place; the array that <b>deal</b> returns.
        </p>
	<blockquote>

		<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Important Note:&nbsp; The <i>first
	</i>Card in the ArrayList will be considered the card that is at the <i>top</i> 
	of the deck.</b>
        When cards are removed from the deck they will be 
	removed from the <i>front</i> of the ArrayList.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="left"><b>You must implement the following methods for the Deck class:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">public Deck() -- </font>
		<font face="Times New Roman">This constructor initializes the Deck with 
		references to 45 card objects, representing the 45 cards that are in a 
                standard Beeblebroxian deck.&nbsp; 
		The cards must be ordered as in the diagram below:</font></p></li>

	which is to the left.</b></p>

	is okay to make a shallow copy of the ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; of cards.

</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">public Card getCardAt(int position) 
	-- </font><font face="Times New Roman">Returns a reference to the card that 
        is at the specified position in the ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;.
        (Uses the usual 0-based indexing.) 
        For this project you can assume only legal requests will be made.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">public int getNumCards() -- </font>
	<font face="Times New Roman">Returns the size of the ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; of 
        Card references.
	(It starts off equal to 45, but becomes smaller as cards are dealt from the 
	deck.)</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">public void cut(int position)--
	</font><font face="Times New Roman">This method divides the deck into two 
	logical subpackets:
             The part <i>above</i> the specified position, and 
             the part that is at the specified position or below.

        The two subpackets are reversed (the top packet is placed on the bottom 
        and the bottom packet is placed on the top.)

        The position value uses 0-based indexing as usual, so the card at the top 
        of the deck (to the left in the diagrams) is at position 0.  Think about how
        you can take advantage of the ArrayList object's ability to add and remove
        individual cards to/from specific positions.  While we will not be having
        a drawing/pseudocode element to this assignment, there are several places 
        (like here) where drawing out a picture of a deck with (for example) only
        8 or 9 cards and tracing on that before you start writing code will
        be very useful.

        Here is an example of a deck being cut:</font></p></li>

	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Courier New">public Card[] deal(int numCards)--
	</font><font face="Times New Roman">This method will remove the specified 
	number of cards from the top of the deck and return them as an array.
	For example, if the parameter is 4, then the first four cards in the deck 
	will be returned as an array of size 4.  This is the <b>one</b> place in 
        this class where an array is used.
        Important:<b> The cards will be removed from the front of the "cards" 
        ArrayList, not the back.</b>  As with the <b>cut</b> method, drawing some 
        pictures and thinking about the add/remove options the ArrayList object
        provides will help make this a smoother section of code to design and implement.
        For this project you can assume only legal requests will be made.

        will consist of:&nbsp; the first card from the top packet, followed by the

<h2 align="left"><u>Running the Deck Simulation</u></h2>
<p align="left"><b>To run the 
simulation execute the main method in the Launcher.java class.</b>
This will allow you to do simple testing of building a deck, cutting
the deck, and dealing a single card from the deck.  
You can cut the deck by clicking somewhere in the middle of the deck.
Deal is accomplished by clicking the button.
However, this is limited and most testing should be done via JUnit and 
the submit server.

<p><u><font size="5"><b>Grading</b></font></u></p>
<p>Your grade will be computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Tests about Deck:&nbsp; 12%</li>
<li>Public Tests about Hands:&nbsp; 28%</li>
<li>Release Tests about Deck:&nbsp; 12%</li>
<li>Release Tests about Hands:&nbsp; 34%</li>
<li>SECRET TESTS:&nbsp; 9% 
    (you will get no feedback regarding these from the submit server)</li> 
<li>JUnit tests written by you in the file StudentTests.java:&nbsp; 5% 
    (you will get no grading feedback regarding these from the submit server)
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NOTE: These are meant to help you test your
code locally, before submitting, to get more practice with that.  Please
don't let the low number of points on this impact its value.
</li> 
	
</ul>
with the exception being that if any of the classes violate the rules given above,
we will go in and remove submit server points connected to any class that was not
written according to the restrictions stated about things like arrays and ArrayLists.
