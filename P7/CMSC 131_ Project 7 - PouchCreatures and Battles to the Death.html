<p><b><font size="5"><u>Objective</u></font></b></p>

<p>
This project will provide you with the opportunity to practice with 
interfaces as well as have some more practice with generic data 
structures, ArrayLists, and two-dimensional structures.  The project
is meant to be done in two phases; Phase 1 before the 3rd exam and
Phase 2 after the 3rd exam.
</p>
<br>
<p><b><u><font size="5">Overview</font></u></b></p>
<p>
In this project you will implement some elements needed for a theoretical
Android game being developed.
In Phase 1 you will build several classes that implement an interface
called Battleable, 
and create a new one-dimensional generic data structure with certain 
rules for adding/removing things; that data structure will be able to
hold any objects that extend the Battleable interface and will support
a simple game of Solitaire.
In Phase 2 you will add to the one-dimensional structure's abilities
by supporting the exporting of data from it.
<!--
, and also build a game 
board that supports a two-dimensional playing space, some basic 
operations, 
and a "move and fight" method. 
-->

<font size="6"><b>Choose Your Battle!</b></font>
</p>
<p>
In this project scenario there is no GUI built yet because another team 
is working on that based on the design spec.  
When they complete their visual design they will make use of the classes 
you have built.  
The application architects have provided you with the
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2016/cmsc131-05XX/Projects/P7/doc/index.html"><b>JavaDocs</b></a>
for the classes, some initial acceptance tests (ExampleTests.java), 
and a wider array of acceptance tests (the ones on the submit server).
</p>
<br>
<p><b><u><font size="5">Phase 1</font></u></b></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First, read through the Universe.java file to see what it provides
       and keep it in mind as you work on the project.
</li>
<li>Next, read the documentation for the <i>Battleable</i> interface, 
       which has been provided.
    In this project there will be at least three classes that implement  
        this interface; 
               PouchCreature, BattleCow, BattleFish.
</li>
<li>Next, read through the BattleCow and BattleFish and PouchCreature
        classes and the method descriptions in the documentation and
        implement them as described.
</li>
<li>Finally, implement the BattleDeck class (other than the two
        export methods export2Darray and export2Darraylist
        and the shuffle method)
        based on the method descriptions in the documentation.   
    This class will support adding deep copies of Battleable objects
        to the structure.  The structure is a double-ended list where
        new things are added to the two ends in alternating order.
    Additionally, the class supports two methods that the game designers
        have requested; 
        the ability to have the 
        Battleable objects at the two ends of the list fight 
        each other in a game of Solitaire (returning the winner)
             and
        the ability to shuffle the deck.
</li>
</ul>


<br>
<p><b><u><font size="5">Phase 2</font></u></b></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Add the ability for your BattleDeck class to export the contents of 
        the structure as a ragged two-dimensional structure; either using
        the Java array (export2Darray) or the ArrayList (export2Darraylist).
</li>
<li>Add the ability to shuffle the deck the way the game designers requested.
</li>
<!--
<li>Implement the BattleBoard methods.   <b>Do we have them do the moving
and fighting part of the game?</b>
</li>
-->
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--
<p><u><b>Notes and hints:</b></u></p>
<ul>
<li> The weakenCreatures() method might be called apart from within the
   fight() method.</li>
<li> The sweepDeck() method might be called apart from within the
   fight() method.</li>
<li> For this project you are allowed to (and will need to) add private fields 
   to some of the classes.</li>
</ul>
-->
<br>
<p><b><u><font size="5">Restrictions</font></u></b></p>
<ul>
<li>You are expected to use good style (as always), including commenting, 
   proper indentation, proper choice of variables names, etc.
</li>
<li>While you are free to choose what you feel are the best internal representations
    for your data, the signatures of the public methods may not be altered.
</li>
<li>Please remember that we will not be using any of the new features that
   Java 8 introduced and that in this course you are not allowed to try to
   use any new features that you might read about elsewhere when doing your
   assignments.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
 
<p><b><u><font size="5">Project Submission</font></u></b></p>
<p>
As always, you will submit your project from Eclipse by right-clicking the 
project folder and selecting "submit project".
You may and should, of course, submit as you feel each part is working to 
get feedback from our tests, and are able to submit as many times as you want 
for public tests, and have the tokens which will regenerate 24 hours after their 
use for release tests.  Remember, we only grade the submission that scores the 
highest on the automated tests
<br><br>
<!--
You should aim for having Phase 1 mostly done and at least lightly tested
by the evening of Wednesday, November 20th.  Over the weekend you should 
work to fix any bugs that remain and be able to pass public tests 1 through ?
and release tests 1 through ?.  You should then read through the Phase 2 
parts of the description and starter code and plan to start working on that
by Wednesday, December 7th with the goal being to complete Phase 2 by the
end of that weekend.
<br><br>
-->
Note that you are strongly encouraged to read the project carefully and test 
your code with your own JUnit tests first, and there will be secret tests
that could look for errors the public and release tests might not reveal.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><font size="5"><b>Grading</b></font></u></p>
<p>Your grade will be computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Tests:&nbsp; 73%</li>
<li>Release Tests:&nbsp; 27%</li>
</ul>
